# fake-twitter
This project is my attempt to demonstrate what I've learned with the MERN stack by developing a Twitter Clone / Social Media App from scratch. 

By the time this project is finished, you should be able to run it simply by replacing the database connection string in the .env file and executing ```docker-compose build``` and ```docker-compose up -d``` in the terminal.
